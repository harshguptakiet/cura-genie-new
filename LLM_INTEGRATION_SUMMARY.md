   - Genomics-specialized prompting system
   - Automatic fallback to mock responses if no provider is configured
   - Real user context integration (PRS scores, genetic variants, recommendations)

2. **Chatbot API Endpoints** (`curagenie-backend/api/chatbot.py`)
   - `POST /api/chatbot/chat` - Main chat endpoint
   - `GET /api/chatbot/context/{user_id}` - Get user genomic context
   - `GET /api/chatbot/health` - Health check with provider status

3. **Configuration System**

   - Loading states and error handling
   - Integration with React Query for API calls
   - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

2. **API Integration**
   - Direct calls to backend chatbot endpoints
   - Proper TypeScript interfaces for type safety
   - Error handling with user-friendly messages

### ✅ Configuration & Documentation
1. **Environment Setup**
   - `.env` file updated with LLM configuration variables
   - `requirements.txt` updated with correct dependencies
   - Clear separation of provider-specific configurations

2. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Complete setup guide (`curagenie-backend/LLM_SETUP_GUIDE.md`)

   - Troubleshooting guide and cost optimization tips

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Test script to validate the entire integration (`curagenie-backend/test_llm_integration.py`)
   - Health check endpoints for monitoring

## 🚀 Current Status

### What Works Now
- **Mock Mode**: Chatbot works with intelligent mock responses based on genomic context
- **Full Architecture**: Complete LLM integration ready for API keys
- **Frontend**: Chat interface fully functional and connected to backend
- **Database Integration**: Fetches real user genomic data for personalized responses

### What Needs API Keys
To activate **real LLM responses**, you need to:

1. **For OpenAI** (Recommended):
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
   LLM_PROVIDER=openai
   ```

2. **For Anthropic Claude**:
   ```env
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key
   LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic
   ```

3. **For Local Ollama** (Free):
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ollama pull llama2
   ```
   ```env
   LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
   ```

## 🧬 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Genomics-Specialized AI Assistant
- **Personalized Context**: Uses real PRS scores and genetic variants from your database
- **Educational Focus**: Explains complex genetic concepts in accessible terms
- **Risk Communication**: Balances genetic risk with lifestyle factors
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Provides evidence-based health guidance

### 2. Real User Data Integration
```python
# Example of what the AI knows about each user:
{
  "prs_scores": {
    "diabetes": {"score": 0.73, "interpretation": "High Risk", "percentile": 73}
  },
  "genomic_variants": [
    {"id": "rs7903146", "chromosome": "10", "type": "SNP"}
  ],
  "risk_conditions": ["diabetes"],
  "recommendations": ["HbA1c monitoring", "Mediterranean diet"]
}
```

### 3. Multi-Provider Architecture
- **Production Ready**: OpenAI GPT for reliable, high-quality responses
- **Alternative Options**: Anthropic Claude for different AI capabilities
- **Local Deployment**: Ollama for privacy-focused or offline scenarios
- **Automatic Fallback**: Graceful degradation if providers are unavailable

## 🎯 Example Conversations

### User: "What does my diabetes risk mean?"
**AI Response**: 
> "Based on your polygenic risk score of 0.73 (73rd percentile), you have an elevated genetic risk for Type 2 diabetes. However, this doesn't mean you'll definitely develop diabetes - it's about probability, not destiny. Your genetics account for about 40-70% of diabetes risk, with lifestyle factors playing a crucial role.
> 
> Looking at your personalized recommendations, I see you have an active diabetes prevention protocol. The key actions include regular HbA1c monitoring every 6 months and following a Mediterranean diet pattern. Would you like me to explain any specific aspects of these recommendations?"

### User: "Tell me about my genetic variants"
**AI Response**:
> "Your genomic analysis identified several key variants that influence your health risks. The most significant finding is the rs7903146 variant on chromosome 10, which is strongly associated with Type 2 diabetes risk. You carry the risk variant, which contributes to your elevated polygenic risk score.
> 
> However, it's important to remember that having this variant doesn't guarantee you'll develop diabetes. Many people with this variant never develop the condition, especially those who maintain healthy lifestyles. Would you like me to explain how this variant affects insulin function?"

## 📊 Testing & Validation

### Quick Test Commands
```bash
# 1. Test backend health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/chatbot/health

# 2. Test chat API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chatbot/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": "test123", "message": "What are my PRS scores?"}'

# 3. Run full integration test
cd curagenie-backend
python test_llm_integration.py

## 💡 Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
User Message → Frontend → FastAPI → LLM Service → Provider (OpenAI/Claude/Ollama)
                    ↓
Database Context ← GenomicLLMService ← Response Processing
                    ↓
Frontend ← Formatted Response ← Genomics-Specialized Prompt
```

### Key Components
- **`GenomicLLMService`**: Main orchestrator, handles user context and provider selection
- **`LLMProvider` Classes**: Abstract interface with provider-specific implementations
- **`Chatbot` API**: FastAPI endpoints for frontend integration
- **Frontend `Chatbot` Component**: React component with real-time messaging
