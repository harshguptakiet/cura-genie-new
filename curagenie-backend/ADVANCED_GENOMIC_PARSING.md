- **Three Disease Models**: Diabetes, Alzheimer's, Heart Disease
- **Variant Matching**: Identification of risk variants in user data
- **Risk Interpretation**: Clinical risk categories (Very Low to Very High Risk)
- **Population-Based Fallback**: Alternative scoring when specific variants not found

### 5. **Quality Control System**
The `GenomicQualityController` provides:
- **Automated Quality Assessment**: Pass/fail determination
- **Issue Detection**: Identification of data quality problems
- **Recommendations**: Actionable advice for data preprocessing

## Integration with Existing System

### Database Models
The implementation seamlessly integrates with existing database models:
- `GenomicData`: Stores comprehensive metadata from advanced parsing
- `PrsScore`: Stores calculated polygenic risk scores with interpretations

### API Integration
The genomic processing tasks have been updated to use the new system:
- `process_genomic_file`: Uses `GenomicProcessor` for comprehensive analysis
- `calculate_prs_score`: Uses real variant-based PRS calculation

### Background Processing
- Maintains existing Celery task structure
- Provides progress updates during processing
- Handles errors gracefully with detailed error messages

## Key Technical Features

1. **Scalability**: Handles large files by processing samples (10K reads for FASTQ, 50K variants for VCF)
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and user-friendly error messages
3. **Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
4. **Type Safety**: Full typing throughout the implementation
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new disease models or analysis features

## Clinical Relevance

The PRS calculations use real effect sizes from published GWAS studies:
- **TCF7L2** variants are among the strongest genetic risk factors for Type 2 diabetes
- **APOE e4** is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease
- The implemented variants represent clinically validated genetic risk factors

## Future Enhancements

1. **Expanded Disease Panels**: Add more diseases and larger SNP panels
2. **Population Stratification**: Account for ancestry-specific effect sizes  
3. **Functional Annotation**: Add gene and pathway information
4. **Clinical Guidelines**: Integrate clinical decision support
5. **Pharmacogenomics**: Add drug response predictions
